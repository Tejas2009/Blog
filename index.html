        <p class="text muted">On May 12, 1983, Domino's opened its first international store, in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.[20] That same year, Domino's opened its 1000th store, its first in Vancouver, Washington. In 1985, the chain opened their first store in the United Kingdom in Luton. Also, in 1985 Domino's opened their first store in Tokyo, Japan. In 1993, they became the second American franchise to open in the Dominican Republic and the first one to open in Haiti, under the direction of entrepreneur Luis de Jesús Rodríguez.[21] By 1995, Domino's had expanded to 1,000 international locations. In 1997, Domino's opened its 1,500th international location, opening seven stores in one day across five continents.[22] By 2014, the company had grown to 6,000 international locations and was planning to expand to pizza's birthplace, Italy; this was achieved on October 5, 2015, in Milan, with their first Italian location. CEO Patrick Doyle, in May 2014, said the company would concentrate on its delivery model there.[23] Faced tough competition from local restaurants and falling behind on its debt obligations, Domino's exited the country in 2022.[24]</p>

 <p> watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>
